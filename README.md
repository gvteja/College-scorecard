Our goal is to build a model that would accurately predict the earnings of a college's graduates after ten years based on the specific features of the college like average cost of attendance, acceptance rate, average test scores etc. Because of the increasing cost of higher education and the accompanying rise of student debt, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the post graduation earnings and ability of the students to repay loans. This model will increase the transparency and will help students to weigh the trade-offs of different colleges and  make more informed decisions.
